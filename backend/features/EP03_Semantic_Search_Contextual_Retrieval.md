description: Epic 3: Semantic Search + Contextual Retrieval
---

This document outlines the development workflow for implementing semantic search, retrieval, and result presentation.

## User Stories Covered

- **US3.1:** As a user, I want to ask natural-language questions and get relevant sections.
- **US3.2:** As a developer, I want to fine-tune retrieval filters (threshold, tags, etc.).
- **US3.3:** As a user, I want to trace which documents were used in a response.

## Planned Implementation Steps

1.  **Module Creation:**

    - A new `retrieval` module will be created within the `rag_system` package to encapsulate all search and retrieval logic.
    - This module will contain its own `router.py`, `services.py`, and `schemas.py`.

2.  **API Endpoint (US3.1):**

    - A new API endpoint, `/retrieve/search`, will be defined in `retrieval/router.py`.
    - It will accept a `POST` request containing the user's natural language query and optional filtering parameters.

3.  **Search Service Logic:**

    - A `SearchService` will be implemented in `retrieval/services.py`.
    - **Query Embedding:** The service will take the user's query, use the existing `ollama_provider` to generate a vector embedding for it.
    - **Semantic Search:** It will then use the `FaissVectorStore.search()` method to perform a top-K semantic search against the indexed chunks.

4.  **Filtering and Scoring (US3.2 & Hybrid Search):**

    - **Request Schema:** A Pydantic model in `retrieval/schemas.py` will define the structure of the search request, including tunable parameters like `top_k`, `score_threshold`, and a dictionary for `metadata_filters` (e.g., `{"tags": "python"}`).
    - **Post-retrieval Filtering:** The `SearchService` will filter the initial results from FAISS based on the provided score threshold and metadata tags.
    - **Hybrid Search (Future Enhancement):** The initial implementation will focus on semantic search. A potential future enhancement is to add a keyword-based search (e.g., BM25 or simple text matching) and combine its score with the semantic similarity score for a more robust hybrid retrieval model.

5.  **Context-Rich, Traceable Results (US3.3):**

    - **Response Schema:** A Pydantic model will define the structure of the search response.
    - Each item in the response list will be a context-rich object containing:
      - The retrieved chunk of text.
      - The similarity score.
      - The complete metadata associated with the chunk, including `file_origin`, `title`, and any other document-level metadata. This provides clear traceability for each piece of retrieved context.

6.  **Integration:**
    - The new `retrieval_router` will be included in the main `FastAPI` application in `main.py` to make the search endpoint accessible.
